# AutoCorrectionToolAI
The Auto Correction Tool is a Python-based utility implemented using Jupyter Notebook that aims to automatically correct spelling and grammar errors in a given text input. The tool utilizes Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and pre-trained language models to identify and suggest corrections for the mistakes present in the text.
Usage
Open the Auto_Correction_Tool.ipynb notebook in Jupyter Notebook.

Run the notebook cell-by-cell to understand the steps and functionalities of the Auto Correction Tool.

Modify the text input: You can test the tool on your own text inputs by changing the text data provided in the notebook.

Observe the auto-corrections: The tool will analyze the input text, detect spelling and grammar errors, and suggest corrected versions of the input.

Experiment with different models (optional): If you have access to multiple NLP models, you can experiment with different models to compare their correction results. Update the code in the notebook accordingly to interact with the desired model.

Customize (Optional)
If you wish to customize the Auto Correction Tool or integrate it into your own project, you can follow these guidelines:

Add your own NLP model: If you have access to a different pre-trained NLP model, you can modify the code in the notebook to use that model for auto-correction.

Extend functionalities: You can enhance the tool by incorporating additional features like grammar suggestion, punctuation correction, or custom rule-based corrections.

Build a web interface: To make the tool more accessible, you can create a web interface using frameworks like Flask or Django.
Acknowledgments
The development of this tool was inspired by the growing importance of Natural Language Processing in various applications. We acknowledge the open-source NLP community and the developers of pre-trained language models for their valuable contributions.
